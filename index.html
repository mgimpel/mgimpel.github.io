<h1>The Tyger</h1>
<p>Tyger Tyger, burning bright,<br>
In the forests of the night;<br>
What immortal hand or eye,<br>
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?</p>
<p>In what distant deeps or skies.<br>
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<br>
On what wings dare he aspire?<br>
What the hand, dare seize the fire?</p>
<p>And what shoulder, & what art,<br>
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?<br>
And when thy heart began to beat.<br>
What dread hand? & what dread feet?</p>
<p>What the hammer? what the chain,<br>
In what furnace was thy brain?<br>
What the anvil? what dread grasp.<br>
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?</p>
<p>When the stars threw down their spears<br>
And water'd heaven with their tears:<br>
Did he smile his work to see?<br>
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?</p>
<p>Tyger Tyger burning bright,<br>
In the forests of the night:<br>
What immortal hand or eye,<br>
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?</p>
